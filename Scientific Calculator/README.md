This README contains instructions on how to use the calculator, its capabilities as well as resources that were used in the process of making it.

## Functionalities
1. Has an easy-to-use and responsive GUI (tkinter)
2. Can perform basic arithmetic (addition, multiplication, subtraction and division)
3. Can perform more advanced arithmetic (modulo, exponents, square roots and cube roots)
4. Can compute logarithms of base 10 and natural logs
5. Can calculate fundamental trigonometric ratios(sines, cosines and tangents)

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your IDE using the `git clone` command.
2. Run the script in the terminal.
3. Click on the buttons to use the calculator and clear the screen with the `CLR` button after each calculation.

## Resources used
The following resources were of great assistance to me as I worked on this project.

- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/)
- [W3Schools Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
- [NeuralNine's tkinter GUI video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibf5cx221hk)
- [NeuralNine's Simple GUI Calculator video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzSCNjn4_RI)


## Things to consider
- The operations have to be input **without syntax errors** for the calculator give output.
- If the Calculator window doesn't pop up for some reason, ensure tkinter is installed properly.
